With my blog posts, I aim to bring to light data analysis, modeling, 
and coding topics that are **often overlooked in publications**. 
We commonly experiment with various 
methodological approaches, and it's the successful ones that usually make it to 
the final publication. However, understanding **what doesn't work** and 
**why certain approaches outperform** others is crucial when planning new analyses. 
I hope that this blog can guide you through the shadowy realm of failed 
analyses and hidden best practices.

## The nature of this blog

The insights shared here are more like **friendly anecdotes** 
than formal scientific observations. So, think of this blog as a casual chat 
in a hallway, rather than a scientific manuscript.
Extensive benchmarks are undoubtedly valuable, but they are out of scope for me. 
If you want to test things out more rigorously, I am sure you can make 
a nice paper out of it. So feel free to use the here-discussed ideas 
as an inspiration.

## Audience

This blog can be of interest to anyone with **applied computational** background. 
While the data we use differs, the ways we approach different challenges 
can be translated across domains. 
Since I come from a computational single-cell biology background, 
my early posts may be biased in this direction. 
However, in the future, I plan to cover a wide variety of topics relevant to 
data analysts and method developers across different data domains. 
If you notice that some of my posts lack explanations, 
please let me know so that I can adjust the content of future posts.

## Updates on new posts

Since this blog is just a hobby of mine, 
the posts will probably be published only every **two or three months**.

I will announce new posts on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karin-hrovatin-3817a6150/) 
and possibly 
[Twitter](https://x.com/KHrovatin).

## Contact

If you want to contact me regarding the blog, 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karin-hrovatin-3817a6150/) 
is the preferred communication channel. 
While I have accounts on some other platforms, 
such as Twitter, I do not regularly use them and will likely miss any 
messages there.
