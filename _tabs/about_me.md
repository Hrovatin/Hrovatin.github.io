## Biological data science

My professional interests broadly revolve around **research** in 
**biological data science**. 

This includes both **understanding the data** at hand 
and **keeping track of machine learning** developments that may be beneficial 
for analyzing the data.

## Data visualization

One of my professional (and also private) hobbies is visual communication 
of scientific **data and concepts**.

Besides making research more approachable, visualizations are also key 
for understanding the data, representing an integral part of my every-day work.

## Other interests

I am interested in **entrepreneurship**. However, I decided to 
first probe the industry world by joining a well-established company.

And of course: I enjoy participating in **scientific communication**. - 
As you may have figured out from this blog. 
While my interest is broader than this blog, there is sadly never
enough time to do everything.
