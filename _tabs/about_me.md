## Biomedical data science

My professional interests broadly revolve around **research** in 
**biological data sciences**. 

This includes both **understanding the data** at hand 
and **keeping track of machine learning** developments that may be beneficial 
for analyzing the data.

### Data visualization

One of my professional (and also private) "hobbies" is visual communication 
of scientific **data and concepts**. 

Among my favourite work-sessions during my PhD
was the chance to describe my battles with `matplotlib` and how I survived them
in this 
[tutorial](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/plotting/advanced.html).
Since I had written the first draft, others have also improved this tutorial. 


Besides that, figuring out with my colleagues
how to make concept figures that save the reader 
time of actually reading the paper was always lots of fun.

Last but not least, visualising the data is in my opinion key for understanding it, 
so it remains an integral part of my every-day work.

## Other interests

I am also interested in **entrepreneurship**. However, I decided to 
first probe the industry world by joining an already established company.

And of course: I enjoy participating in **scientific communication**, 
as you may have deduced from the existence of this blog.
