The contents of the blog posts, including figures, are under **CC BY 4.0 license, 
with the following additions** to the license: 

- **Attribute in text**: The attribution of figures must be given directly beside 
each figure. It should not be done only at the end of the material, 
such as in the footnotes or the acknowledgment section.
- **Use my full name**: For in-text attribution of figures or direct quotes, 
you must always use my full name without abbreviations (Karin Hrovatin). 
Additional information, such as the access date and relevant URLs, 
can be added to the reference list. When listing additional information within 
the reference list, the reference list can use an abbreviated name, 
as per the reference style format you use.
- **Provide the “modified CC BY 4.0” license**: 
When attributing the figures or direct quotes, you must always clearly specify 
that the content is under a “modified CC BY 4.0” license. 
In this case, the license information must be added to both in-text references 
and the reference list. You must always provide a link to this page,
which explains how the CC BY 4.0 license was modified. 
You are permitted to omit the license link from the in-text citations if 
you provide the link within the reference list.

Please note that some of the materials are from external sources and are under a different license.

 **Attribution examples**

In-text attribution (e.g. for figures): 

>The content was created by Karin Hrovatin and is under a modified CC BY 4.0 license.

List of references: 

>Hrovatin, K., *Blog title*, *Blog URL*, accessed on: *date*. 
> License: modified CC BY 4.0 license, *URL to this license*.

Please adapt the text in italics as needed.

## Acknowledging materials for internal use

Some tend to omit attribution for internal presentations, 
as “no one will know”. Since I invested a lot of time and resources 
into this blog, especially the artwork, I would nevertheless 
appreciate it, if you at least listed my name beside my artwork.
